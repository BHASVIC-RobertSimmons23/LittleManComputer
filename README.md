# Little Man Computer
A collection of small LMC programs that I created to whilst myself the LMC instruction set
### Usage
These programs can be run using Peter Higginson's [Little Man Computer Emulator](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/)
### Tasks:
1. Prompts for two numbers and outputs their difference ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task1.txt))
2. Outputs the numbers one through 10 ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task2.txt))
3. Counts up to a given number in increments of 2 ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task3.txt))
4. Multiplies two numbers together ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task4.txt))
5. Checks if two inputs are the same ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task5.txt))
6. Squares a given input (regardless of the sign of the original number) ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task6.txt))
7. Ouputs the highest and lowest of three input numbers ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task7.txt))
8. Divides one number by another, giving the quotient and remainder ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/task8.txt))
9. Carries out exponentiation ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/LittleManComputer/blob/main/exponentiation.txt))
